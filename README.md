Creating a child process means the operating system starts a separate, independent program from the main (parent) process. The child gets its own memory, process ID, and runs separately, either as a copy of the parent (in languages like C using fork()) or as a new program (in Java using ProcessBuilder). The parent and child run independently, and the parent can wait for the child to finish if needed. Child processes are isolated, so errors in the child won’t affect the parent, making them useful for running separate tasks, improving safety, or parallel processing. Unlike threads, child processes don’t share memory and have more overhead but provide stronger separation.# ForkSysCall
